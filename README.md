# Honda Mobility Hacks

# Powered by P3 and Continental

Welcome to the Honda Mobility Hackathon. 

This repository holds two datasets that you will be using through the span of the Hackathon:

- Connected Vehicles Data

You are free to choose either or both datasets but the use of at least one of the above datasets is required. 

You can also use any publicly available data sets for your hacks.
