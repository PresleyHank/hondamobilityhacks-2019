# Honda Mobility Hacks

# Powered by P3 and Continental

Welcome to the Honda Mobility Hackathon. 

[JOIN THE SLACK!](https://join.slack.com/t/hondamobilityhacks/shared_invite/enQtNTI3ODUxMzc2NDM5LWQxNTNhMzE1MGQ3MzU1N2VlOTQwYjA3OWQ0MDMyYTM3NDQ3MTdkOTQ3ZmJiYzZkYWNkMDA1YmNjNzhjOWQ5MTQ)

This repository holds two datasets that you will be using through the span of the Hackathon:

-  Autonomous Driving Data
- Connected Vehicles Data

You are free to choose either or both datasets but the use of at least one of the above datasets is required. 

You can also use any publicly available data sets for your hacks.

## Autonomous Driving Data

Sensory data from an autonomous vehicle driven in Detroit and Ann Arbor area.

## Connected Vehicle Data

Vehicles and traffic signals on the US 33 Corridor in Ohio are equipped with Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) radios to transmit safety messages and deliver Signal Phase And Timing (SPAT) data.

The goal is to create an environment where Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) technology can be tested.
