# Java Code Examples

This covers basic AWS DynamoDB and S3 interactions using the Java SDK. It only applies to the AWS SDK v1.11.478. While you are welcome to use the new AWS SDK v2.0, it has been **MASSIVELY** overhauled to the point that very little, if any, of the sample code contained in this repository will be applicable to it. If you have previous experience using v2.0, you are more than welcome to, just make sure that you get the needed bucket and table names from the samples provided in order to be able to pull data.

**The goal of this guide is to provide enough information for you to access the data without having to spend time on a deep-dive of the official documentation.**

All Java DynamoDB and S3 sample code and documentation are in their respective folders.
